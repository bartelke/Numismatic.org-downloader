# Roman Empire Coins - Numismatic.org downloader

This repository contains two Python scripts designed for downloading and organizing images of Roman Empire coins from the American Numismatic Society (ANS) website. The main objective is to create a comprehensive dataset of Roman coin images for research purposes, specifically focusing on coins from various Roman emperors.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to gather images of Roman coins, which can serve as a valuable dataset for research in numismatics, historical studies, or machine learning applications. Currently, two scripts are included in the repository:

- `download.py`: Downloads images of coins from a specified Roman emperor.
- `delete.py`: Removes specific coin images (either obverses or reverses) from the dataset based on image numbering.

Some non-coin images are also present in the dataset due to the layout of the ANS website. These can be manually removed, though a future improvement may automate this cleanup process.
